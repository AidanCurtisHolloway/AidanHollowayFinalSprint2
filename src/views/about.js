              I&apos;m a 19-year-old student from Glovertown, Newfoundland, and
              I&apos;m really into graphic design. I&apos;m a bit quiet when you
              first meet me, but once we get talking, I can chat up a storm.
              Designing is my thing, especially websites. I&apos;ve got a good
              sense for what people like and how they feel, which helps me
              create simple and minimalist designs that click.

              I love the whole less-is-more vibe, and I&apos;m all about making
              things look clean and stylish. I might not be the loudest voice,
              but my designs do the talking for me. Websites are my jam, and
              I&apos;m not just about the looks â€“ I&apos;m into making them easy
              to use too. I like playing around with how things work and making
              them look cool at the same time.

              I keep an eye on the latest design trends and tools to stay in the
              loop. Whether I turn this passion into a job or not, I&apos;m just
              enjoying the ride. If you want to talk about graphic design, web
              design, or anything like that, I&apos;m all ears!
